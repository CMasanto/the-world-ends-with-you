# the-world-ends-with-you
I created an abridged version of The World Ends With You (a Nintendo DS game) for my Interactive Computing class.
I used Processing to create this game and animate the sprites.

## Example
The user is able to roam around a single area in the game, and can enter battles by first selecting the pin at the bottom-right corner of the screen and then clicking on the floating red icon.
